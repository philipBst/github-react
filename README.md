# RepoFinder

RepoFinder is a simple react application using the github's openapi to search through repositories.

## Setup

Use git to clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philipBst/github-react.git
```

Change into project directory

```bash
cd github-react
```

Install dependencies using pnpm(preferred) or npm or yarn

```bash
pnpm i
```

Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

That's it, your local development server should start on [https://localhost:5173](https://localhost:5173)
