# RepoFinder

Foobar is a simple react application using the github's openapi to search through repositories.

## Setup

Use git to clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philipBst/github-react.git
```

Install dependencies using pnpm(preferred) or npm or yarn

```bash
pnpm i
```

Start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then your local development server should start on [https://localhost:5173](https://localhost:5173)

## Alternatively

If you have docker setup on your system, simply clone the repo as shown above and run below command

```bash
docker-compose up
or
docker compose up
